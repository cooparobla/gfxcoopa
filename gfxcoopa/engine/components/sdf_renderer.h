/**
 * @file sdf_renderer.h
 * @brief Component defining the 3D bounds of a raymarched signed-distance-field object.
 *
 * An SdfRenderer does not itself describe any geometry -- it collects
 * SdfShape components (see sdf_shape.h) from its own object and every
 * descendant, in child-list order, and marks the owning object's subtree as
 * one raymarchable object. This is the same pattern MeshRenderer uses for
 * triangle meshes, except the "mesh" here is an arbitrary hierarchy of
 * primitives instead of a single asset: each SdfShape's own
 * TransformComponent places it, so moving/rotating/scaling a child object
 * moves/rotates/scales that primitive using the engine's ordinary transform
 * system, with no SDF-specific placement fields duplicated here.
 *
 * bounds_center/bounds_extent define a local-space box, relative to the
 * SdfRenderer's own object's transform. The render pipeline transforms this
 * box's 8 corners into clip space to find both the screen-space (pre-upscale)
 * rectangle the object's pixels raymarch within and the AABB the in-shader
 * ray/box slab test clips the march to -- see gfx_sdf_aabb_intersect() in
 * gfx/sdf.glsl. Pixels outside that rectangle never invoke the raymarch loop
 * at all: this bounds box IS the performance story for the whole system, so
 * it should be kept as tight as the authored shapes allow, not left at the
 * (1,1,1) default for anything non-trivial.
 *
 * material reuses PBRMaterial verbatim (see mesh_renderer.h) so an SDF object
 * has exactly the same material surface as a mesh: albedo/metallic/roughness/
 * ao/emissive, plus alpha/alpha_mode selecting between the deferred G-buffer
 * path (Opaque/Mask) and the forward BLEND path (Blend) -- the same split
 * MeshRenderer's material drives for triangle geometry.

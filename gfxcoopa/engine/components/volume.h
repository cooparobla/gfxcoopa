/**
 * @class VolumeComponent
 * @brief Local, artist-placed, raymarched volume. Always bounded.
 *
 * The single local-volume concept in the engine. Fog is GLOBAL only and lives in
 * the renderer config (LightUBO's fog block, light_data.h); everything local -- including a static
 * fog pocket -- is one of these, raymarched by VolumetricsPass.
 *
 * `kind` selects the density function; every other field means the same thing for
 * all three kinds, which is what lets one march serve all of them.
 *
 * The defaults below are the Wind ones. The three kinds want very different
 * values and a C++ struct can only carry one set, so the SCENE PARSER applies
 * kind-specific defaults after reading `kind` and before reading anything else
 * (see register.h). That is what keeps authoring short: a volume declaring only
 * `kind: haze`, a Transform and an extent comes out looking like haze.
 *
 * IMPORTANT -- this does NOT enable the pass. `volumetrics_enabled` in the
 * renderer config is the master switch and is startup-fixed.

/**
 * @struct ExtraSets
 * @brief Optional app-supplied descriptor sets, appended AFTER a pass's own
 *        sets in its pipeline layout.
 *
 * Replaces the previous pattern of a pass taking a specific
 * `VkDescriptorSetLayout gi_layout` parameter and binding a specific
 * `gi::GiSystem*` at a hardcoded set index: that baked one particular
 * subsystem into gfxcoopa's pass layouts, and -- worse -- declared the set
 * in the pipeline layout UNCONDITIONALLY, so passing a null system at
 * execute() time left the set undeclared-but-present, an unbound set rather
 * than a shader genuinely built without it.
 *
 * `layouts` and `bind` are kept in one struct deliberately: the entire class
 * of bug this type exists to prevent is a layout and its binder drifting
 * apart, so the type makes them travel together and validate() turns a
 * mismatch into a startup exception instead of a validation-layer warning
 * discovered at draw time.
 *
 * `bind` takes no VkPipelineLayout: every call site invokes it after the
 * pass's own cmd.bind_pipeline(), which already caches that pipeline's
 * layout on CommandBuffer for the sealed bind_descriptor_set()/
 * push_constants() overloads to use -- see command_buffer.h's bound_pipeline_.

 * @struct IndirectParams
 * @brief The indirect-lighting terms a lighting pass ADDS and an SSR
 *        composite SUBTRACTS (see gfx/indirect_specular.glsl and
 *        SsrPass::CompositePushConstants).
 *
 * Held in one struct, and fed to both the lighting pass and the SSR pass
 * from a single instance, so the two can never be fed different values by
 * accident -- a mismatch here is invisible in code review and shows up on
 * screen as a faint reflection-shaped residue where the SSR composite's
 * subtraction fails to cancel what the lighting pass added. Pass this by
 * reference into both the lighting pass's push constants and
 * SsrPass::Params rather than copying individual floats out of it, so
 * there is exactly one thing to plumb through and no way to source the two
 * call sites from different values.

/**
 * @page render_features_policy Runtime vs. startup-only feature flags
 *
 * Every gfxcoopa consumer's render config follows one naming convention so
 * the two tiers stay visually distinguishable at the declaration site:
 *
 *   - Fields ending in `_enabled` are RUNTIME flags: the pass(es) they
 *     gate are always constructed, and the flag is re-read every frame to
 *     decide whether to execute/composite them. Flipping one of these at
 *     runtime (a debug UI, a config hot-reload) takes effect on the next
 *     frame with no pipeline rebuild.
 *   - Fields WITHOUT that suffix are STARTUP-ONLY: they change a pipeline
 *     layout, a descriptor set layout, or a target's format/extent, and are
 *     read once at construction. Changing one requires re-constructing the
 *     owning pipeline (or, for a handful, an explicit `recreate()`/resize
 *     path).
 *
 * | Tier | Typical fields |
 * |---|---|
 * | Runtime | `shadows_enabled`, `ssao_enabled`, `ssr_enabled`, `transparency_enabled`, `skybox_enabled`, `outline_enabled`, `palette_enabled`, `dither_enabled`, `*_temporal_enabled` |
 * | Startup | `gi_enabled` (adds a descriptor set to two pipeline layouts), `ssr_half_res`, `msaa_4x`, every resolution/format field |
 *
 * `IndirectParams::ssgi_intensity` is a value, not a flag: 0.0 disables the
 * diffuse-bounce term entirely inside the shared shader body with no C++
 * branch, which is what makes SSGI a free, always-available option for a
 * consumer whose composite shader implements it and a total no-op for one
 * that doesn't.

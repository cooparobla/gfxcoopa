/**
 * @file enums.h
 * @brief gfxcoopa-owned scalar enums for pipeline, resource, and image state.
 *
 * These replace `Vk*` enums in every gfxcoopa public signature. They are
 * deliberately NOT 1:1 mirrors of their Vulkan counterparts — each is
 * narrowed to the values gfxcoopa's API actually needs, with values added on
 * demand rather than up front. This header (and the rest of `gfxcoopa/types/`)
 * must never include volk or GLFW: that invariant is what makes the
 * `coopa::gfx_pure` CMake target and the "headless tests never touch Vulkan"
 * guarantee structural rather than aspirational. Vulkan-side conversion lives
 * only in `gfxcoopa/detail/vk_convert.h`. The keyboard/mouse vocabulary
 * lives in `coopa/input/` in libcoopa for the same reason -- it depends on
 * neither Vulkan nor GLFW. See coopa/input/README.md.

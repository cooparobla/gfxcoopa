# GfxShaders.cmake -- incremental GLSL -> SPIR-V compilation.
#
# Single copy, owned by gfxcoopa. Consumers reach it via
# `include(${GFXCOOPA_DIR}/cmake/GfxShaders.cmake)` (already implicitly
# available after `add_subdirectory(gfxcoopa)`, since CMake function
# definitions are global once the defining file has been processed) rather
# than copying this file into their own cmake/.
#
# Mirrors `cbuild --vulkan` (the primary build tool for this workspace, see
# /home/coopa/.sww/packages/cbuild/cbuild), which takes its -I paths from
# assets/shaders/.glslc_flags; this function passes the equivalent -I paths
# itself and does not read that file. Unlike cbuild -- which always
# recompiles everything -- this target is incremental via glslc -MD depfiles:
# editing a shared gfx/*.glsl body correctly retriggers every .vert/.frag
# that includes it, which a file(GLOB) + DEPENDS-on-the-source-only rule
# cannot see (glslc's -I search means an includer's dependency set isn't
# knowable from its own path alone).
#
# Requires CMake >= 3.20: DEPFILE on add_custom_command was Ninja-only before
# 3.20, when Makefile-generator support was added. This workspace has no
# ninja installed, so it's on the Makefile generator and needs this floor.

# invoked gfx_add_shader_target), not this file's own directory, so a
# consumer's call would resolve gfxcoopa's shader dir relative to the
# consumer. At this file's top level CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR is this file's
# directory; CMake variables are dynamically scoped, so the function sees the
